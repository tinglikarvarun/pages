    </div>
    <div class="intro"><p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which famously include most sixes in international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[5] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.<br><br>

        Sharma formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2022.<br><br>
        
        Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.</p></div>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.[6] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[7] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[8] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[9] His mother tongue is Telugu.

            Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[9] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match, with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014.[6] He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket.[108] In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[109] During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.[110]

                On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[111] In the same series, he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.[112]
                
                On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553).[113] His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.[114]
                
                On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.[115] This feat occurred during a highly anticipated India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 100,000 enthusiastic fans.[116] The Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant Strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.
                
                On 22 October 2023, during a thrilling encounter against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the 'Hitman,' etched his name in the annals of cricket history. In a remarkable feat, he became the first Indian batter to smash 50 One Day International (ODI) sixes in a single calendar year.[117] This incredible display of power-hitting is a testament to Rohit's batting prowess and his ability to dominate the limited-overs format. With each mighty swing of his bat, Rohit Sharma continues to redefine the boundaries of achievement and captivate cricket enthusiasts around the world, solidifying his status as one of the most prolific and electrifying batters in the game.
